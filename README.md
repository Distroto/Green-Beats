# Green Beats 🎵🌱

**Green Beats** is a climate-conscious concert companion app that empowers fans to reduce their environmental impact — starting with the biggest contributor to concert emissions: **fan travel**.

This proof-of-concept calculates individual carbon footprints based on travel modes to concerts, rewards greener choices, and showcases artists’ sustainability efforts — making every gig a greener one.

---

## 🌍 Problem

Live music events generate **massive carbon footprints**, with **fan travel accounting for up to 80%** of total emissions. Despite growing awareness, there's no unified tool for fans or artists to track, reduce, or celebrate low-carbon choices.

## ✅ Features (MVP)

- 🎫 **Concert Selector** – Pick a show you're attending  
- 🚗 **Travel Mode Input** – Choose how you’ll get there (car, bike, metro, walk)  
- 🧮 **Carbon Calculator** – Estimate CO₂ emissions based on mode + distance  
- 📊 **Visual Feedback** – See your impact instantly  
- 🏅 **Reward System** – Earn green badges for low-carbon travel  
- 🧠 *(Stretch)* **Artist Green Profile** – AI-generated summaries of artist sustainability efforts
