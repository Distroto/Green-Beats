# Green Beats 🎵🌱

**Green Beats** is a climate-conscious concert companion app that empowers fans to reduce their environmental impact — starting with the biggest contributor to concert emissions: **fan travel**.

---

## 🌍 Problem

Live music events generate **massive carbon footprints**, with **fan travel accounting for up to 80%** of total emissions. Despite growing awareness, there's no unified tool for fans or artists to track, reduce, or celebrate low-carbon choices.

- 📊 **Visual Feedback** – See your impact instantly
